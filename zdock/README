				ZDOCK 3.0.1

This is the README file for release 3.0.1 of ZDOCK program. ZDOCK is an
initial stage protein-protein docking program, developed initially by
Rong Chen and Zhiping Weng in 2002. It optimizes pairwise shape 
complementarity, an interface contact potential called IFACE, and 
electrostatic energies using the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. The 
FFT is optimized for speed and memory usage using the Conv3D library. If
you use ZDOCK 3.0.1 for your work, please cite:

Using a New 3D Convolution Library to Enhance Docking Efficiency"

This distribution includes an executable file (zdock) of the ZDOCK program,
PDB processing file (mark_sur, uniCHARMM, block.pl), and auxiliary files
(create.pl, create_lig) to create predicted complex structures from a ZDOCK
output.

Example:
mark_sur PDB new_PDB
zdock -R receptor.pdb -L ligand.pdb -o zdock.out
create.pl zdock.out

Attention: receptor.pdb, ligand.pdb and create_lig must be in your current
directory when you try to create all predicted structures using create.pl.

Standard PDB format files must be processed by mark_sur before used as the
input of ZDOCK. Formatted PDB files of docking benchmark can be downloaded at
http://zlab.bu.edu/zdock/benchmark.shtml. If you know that some atoms
are not in the binding site, you can block them by changing their ACE type
(column 55-56) to 19. This blocking procedure can improve docking
performance significantly. A blocking script block.pl is included, type
"block.pl" for usage information.

More options can be found by typing "zdock".
